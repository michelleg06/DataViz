# Storytelling with `data visualisation ![Logo](https://github.com/michelleg06/DataViz/blob/main/images/Storytelling.png)

## Introduction
This repository hosts graphs and other forms of data visualisation that I have found useful throughout my research. The compendium is not exhaustive, and will be evolving as I discover new ways to express data graphically. Most of what I visualise is done with `ggplot2`in the `R` language. Some visualisations will come from Python <i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i>, and some additional edits might be done outside of a programming language. I will indicate this when or if it happens.
